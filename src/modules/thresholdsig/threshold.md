Threshold and Multisignatures with the MuSig Module
===========================

This module implements Schnorr signatures, a batch verifier for Schnorr
signatures that can also batch-verify Taproot commitments, and threshold
signatures/multisignatures. This document focuses on threshold signatures.

Multisignatures are described in the MuSig paper [1]. Threshold signatures
are a generalization of these in which all participants distribute "shards"
of their keys to all other participants, enabling signature creation
without all signers present.

### Terminology

A _Schnorr signature_ with public key `P` on message m is a pairs `(s, R)`,
where `s` is a scalar, `R` is a curvepoint, which satisfies the equation

    sG = R + eP

where `e` is some hash of `P`, `R`, and the message. We will not worry about
the specific curve or hash used, but see [2] for a full specification.

A _multisignature_ is such a signature produced by `n` signers, labelled
1 through `n`, who each contribute a pair `(s_i, R_i)` such that

    sum_i R_i = R
    sum_i s_i = s

we refer to each `R_i` as a _partial nonce_ and each `s_i` as a _partial
signature_.

A _threshold signature_ is such a signature that may be produced by any
`k` signers out of a fixed set of `n`. Production of such a signature
requires an additional step in which each participant splits his secret
key into `n` _key shards_, one for each participant including himself.

### Key Generation Procedure

Let `n` signers each have a keypair `(x_i, X_i)` for `i` ranging from 0 to
`n-1`. We define their _combined public key_ as

    P = sum_i µ_i*X_i = sum_i Y_i

where `µ_i = H(L || i)`, where `H` is a collision-resistant hash function
and `L` is a hash of all public keys in some canonical order. We refer to
the coefficient `µ_i` as the _MuSig coefficient_ of the key, and to the
key `Y_i = µ_i*X_i` as the _tweaked public key_.

Observe that the public key `P` will be the same for any `k-of-n` signature
which begins with the same keys `X_i`. In particular, it does not depend
on the threshold value `k`.

Key Generation works as follows.

1. All signers agree on their initial public keys `X_i` through some external
   procedure this API does not cover.
2. Each signer uses `secp256k1_musig_pubkey_combine` to compute the combined
   public key `P`. This function also outputs a list `Y_i` of tweaked public
   keys, which will be needed to validate partial signatures.
3. Each signer modifies her secret key by multiplying it with the coefficient
   `µ_i`  to produce a secret key `y_i` compatible with her public key `Y_i`.  
   This is done in `secp256k1_thresholdsig_keysplit`.

Assuming the participants agree beforehand on the set of public keys, there
is no interaction required. However, if the threshold `k` is less than `n`,
there are two additional rounds of interaction required, across the following
four steps.

4. Each participant splits her secret key `secp256k1_thresholdsig_keysplit`.
   This function outputs an array of private _keyshards_, one for each
   participant, as well as an array of _public coefficients_ which must be
   broadcast to all other signers.
5. Each participant, upon receiving a private keyshard and a set of public
   coefficients, runs `secp256k1_thresholdsig_verify_shard` to check consistency
   of these. This function outputs a modified set of public keys `{Z_i}`
   and a modified secret key `z_i`, which the signer should use in place of
   the keys produced in steps 2 and 3. (Specifically, on the first invocation
   `secp256k1_thresholdsig_verify_shard` outputs keys which it updates on
   subsequent invocations, until all participants' shards and coefficients have
   been taken into account.)
6. [TODO] She signs the each set of coefficients and broadcasts her signatures.
7. [TODO] each participant verifies each others' signatures.

}
```

### Signing Procedure

To produce a signature, each signer `i` acts as follows.

1. Produces a nonce pair `(k_i, R_i)` and a commitment (hash) `C_i` to `R_i`.
   This is done with `secp256k1_musig_session_get_public_nonce`. Sends the
   commitment `C_i` to every other signer.
2. Once at least `k` nonce commitments have been received from other signers,
   signer `i` creates `n` `secp256k1_musig_session_signer_data` structures, one
   for each signer including herself.
   She initializes each with `secp256k1_thresholdsig_session_initialize` which
   takes a public key from all signers and a nonce commitment from present
   signers. If `k = n`, the public key should be `Y_i` from step 2 of the key
   setup; otherwise it should be `Z_i` from step 5 of key setup.
3. She sends her actual public nonce `R_i` to every other signer.
4. Upon receipt of another signer's public nonce, she calls
   `secp256k1_musig_set_nonce` to update that signer's data structure.
   If the public nonce does not match the precommitment, this function will fail
   and the signer will be considered not to be present.
5. Once `k` valid public nonces have been received, she can produce a partial
   signature using `secp256k1_musig_partial_sign`. She sends this partial
   signature to someone (or everyone) for aggregation.
   [TODO] Things will work with more than `k` signers; if people disagree on the
   set of signers this is a problem, so "just take the first `k`" is actually
   likely to fail in the case of `>k`.
6. Some participant receives all the partial signatures and combines them using
   `secp256k1_musig_partial_sig_combine`. The output of this function is a
   complete signature. If the signature is invalid, at least one of the partial
   signatures was invalid. The culprit may be identified using the function
   `secp256k1_thresholdsig_partial_sig_verify` on the individual partial
   signatures.

### Underlying Algebra

#### Multisignatures

In the case of multisignatures, i.e. `n`-of-`n` threshold signatures, the algebra
is very simple. In `secp256k1_musig_partial_sign`, all participants' public nonces
are added to get a total public nonce. Each participant computes a messagehash
using this total public nonce and signs with their tweaked secret key.

The signatures are then summed, resulting in a signature whose key is the sum
of the signers' keys.

#### Threshold Signatures

In the case of threshold signatures, construction is a bit more involved. To
recall terminology, signer `i` has tweaked secret key `y_i`, tweaked public key
`Y_i`, and the total key is `P = sum_i Y_i` with the sum taken over all signers.

When splitting her secret key `y_i`, signer `i` calls
`secp256k1_thresholdsig_keysplit`, which outputs two things. First, a set of
_private shards_ `y_i,j`, one for each signer `j`, which satisfies the following
equation

    y_i = sum_j L_j * y_i,j                              (1)

with the sum taken any subset of `k` or more signers. The coefficients `L_j`
depend on the subset chosen, but the shards and total key do not. The details
of determining these coefficients are given in the next section.

Second, `secp256k1_thresholdsig_keysplit` outputs a set of _public coefficients_,
which are curvepoints `P_n` satisfying

    y_i,j*G = sum_{n=0}^{k-1} j^n * P_n                    (2)

This is equation `(*)` from [3]. What `secp256k1_thresholdsig_verify_shard` does
is to check this equation for the shard `y_i,j` that signer `j` has possession
of, and also uses the equation to compute

    Z_j = sum_i y_i,j*G                                  (3)

That is, `secp256k1_thresholdsig_verify_shard` computes the public key equivalent
of all signers' shards of all signers keys, checks that the caller's private
shards are consistent with the computed public shards, and then sums them up.

Assuming all signers see the same set of coefficents `P_n`, they will all
compute the same set of points `Z_j`. Signer `j` will find that the sum of
her private shards is the discrete logarithm of `Z_j`, and that in general

    P = sum_j L_j * Z_j                                  (4)

That is, these public points `Z_j` satisfy the same summation equation as
the individual shares. This can be easily derived:

    sum_j L_j * Z_j
        = sum_j L_j * sum_i y_i,j * G
        = sum_i [sum_j L_j y_i,j] * G
        = sum_i y_i * G
        = P

Therefore, after key setup, each signer's secret key is replaced with `z_j`,
the sum of their shards, and public key is replaced by `Z_j`, which can be
computed by everyone.

During signing, `secp256k1_thresholdsig_session_initialize` and
`secp256k1_musig_set_nonce` track which signers are present and which are missing.
If at least `k` signers are present, this uniquely determines a set `L_j` of
Lagrange coefficients.

Each signer `j` calls `secp256k1_musig_partial_sign` to sign. When computing the
total nonce, it uses the equation

    R = sum_j L_j * R_j

where the sum is over all present signer, and each `R_j` is a signer's public nonce.
The signature is computed as

    s_j = k_j + z_j * e

Finally, in `secp256k1_musig_partial_sig_combine`, each signature is multiplied by
`L_j`, resulting in a total signature that satisfies

    s*G = sum_j L_j * s_j * G
        = sum_j L_j * k_j * G + e * sum_j L_j * z_j * G
        = sum_j L_j * R_j + e * sum_j L_j * Z_j
        = R + e * P

#### Lagrange Coefficients

It remains to describe in a bit more detail how the coefficients `L_j`, called
called _Lagrange coefficients_, are actually computed. Essentially, they come
from the formula for Lagrange interpolation given in [4].

When the `i`th signer calls `secp256k1_musig_pubkey_combine`, a uniformly
random polynomial `p_i` of degree `k-1` is chosen such that `p_i(0) = y_i`.
The public coefficients `P_i,n` are simply the coefficients of this polynomial
multiplied by G; observe that `P_i,0 = p_i(0)*G = Y_i`.

The private shard given to signer `j` is simply `p(j)`. Knowing this, and
the fact that `y_i = p(0)`, we see that equation (1) is a direct application
of the Lagrgange interpolation formula, while equation (2) is just

    p_i(x) * G = sum_n x_n * P_i,n

evaluated at `j`.

Now, let

    P(x) = sum_i P_i(x)

where the sum is taken over all signers; then

    P(0) = sum_i P_i(0) = sum_i Y_i = P

and equation (3) becomes

    Z_j = sum_i y_i,j*G = sum_i p_i(j)*G = p(j)*G

i.e. the `Z_j`s are just evaluations of the sum polynomial `p`, whose 0th
coefficient is the total public key. Of course Lagrange interpolation applies
to this just as it did to the `p_i`s, which gives us equation (4)

    P = sum_j L_j * Z_j

from which we concluded that the `Z_j`s were public shards of `P`.
